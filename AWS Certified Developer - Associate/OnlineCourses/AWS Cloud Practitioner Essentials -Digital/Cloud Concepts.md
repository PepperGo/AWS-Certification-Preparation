## AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials: Cloud Concepts 

### Cloud Computing 
"Cloud Computing" refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applicaitons via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.  

(Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility. - wiki)  

### AWS features
With AWS:
- Initiated within seconds  
servers, databases, storges, and higher-level application components can be initiated within seconds.  
- Treated these as "temporary and disposable" resources  
- Free from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure

By harnessing the power of AWS Cloud, your approach to change management, testing, reliability, and capacity planning is more agile and efficient.

### Agility
One main reason companies are moving to the cloud is increased agility.  
There are three factors that influence agility:  
- Speed  
- Experimentation  
- Culture of innovation  

#### Speed(Increase Speed and Global Reach)  
- Global reach with a moment's notice  
- New resources are a click away  
- Dramatic increase in agility  

#### Expermentation(Increase Expermentation)  
- AWS enables operations as code  
- Safely experiment, develop operations procedures, and practice failure  
- For example:  
  - Spin up servers in minutes for experimenting  
  - Return or re-purpose servers
- Testing using different configurations  
- AWS CloudFormation enables templated enviroments  

#### Innovation(Increase Innovation)  
- Experiment quickly with low cost/rish  
- More experimentation more often  
- Discovery  

### Understand how AWS utilizes the agility of cloud computing
- support elasticity, scalability, and reliability of computing resources  
- Regions  
  - physical location in the world  
  - contains multiple availablility zones
- Availability Zones(AZs)
  - one ore more discrete data centers
  - Redundant: power, networking, connectivity  
  - Housed in separate facilities  
  
#### Availability Zones
AZs offer the ability to operate production applications and databases which are more highly available, fault tolerant and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.    
- Fault tolerance
  - Applications remain operational if some of the components of that system failure  
  - Can be seen as the built-in redundancy of an application's components  
- High availability   
  - Systems always functioning and accessible  
  - Downtime is minimized as much as possible  
  - Without human intervention  
  
By utilizing the AWS cloud, you can take advantage of scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure to best meet your requirements.  

### Elasticity
In relation to agility, elasticity is also a powerful force in cloud computing.  
- Elasticity is the power to scale computing resources up or down easily.  
Only paying for the actual resources uesd
- elastic nature of AWS allows:  
  - Quickly deploy new applications  
  - Instantly scale up as the workload grows  
  - Instantly shut down resources that are no longer required  
  - Scale down and don't pay for the infrastructure  
  
AWS provides the elastic infrastruture to meet your needs.  
- Use services at your own pace  
- Adapt their consumption  
- Launch new services or products  
- Accommodate new strategic directions  

### Tools  
- Tools to run a wide range of applications  
- Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing  
  - Scale up or down based on demand  
- Deploy your system in multiple regions  
  - Lower latency and better experience  
- Innovative services and cutting-edge technology  
- Support virtually any workload  

### Security and Compliance  
- Customer retains control over region where data located  
- AWS cloud provides governance capabilities  
- Industry-leading capabilities that meet the strictest security requirements  

Data Centers:  
- State-of-the-art electronic surveillance  
- Multi-factore access control systems  
- Staffed 24/7 by trained security guards  
- Access is strictly least-privileged basis  
- Environmental systems minimize the impace of disruptions  
- Multiple regions and availablity zones enable resiliency  
  

Security policy can be formalized and embedded with the design of your infrastructure.  

#### Reliablity 
- Give high performing and reliable solutions to address most business needs  
- Give the tools to implement solutions quickly and with limited friction  
- Reliability  
  - Ability to recover from failures  
  - Ability to dynamically acquire resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions  
- Your architecture and system must have well-planned foundation  
  - can handle changes in demand  
  - detect failure and automatically heal itself  
  
- Achieve greater flexibility and capacity  
- Reduce uncertainty of forecasting hardware needs  
- Capacity and reliability that is difficult to match by on-premise solutions  

### Pricing  
Pay as you go
